Engadget, a font by John Stracke, <http://www.thibault.org/fonts/>.

This font is called Engadget because it is based on the modernistic
letters in the logo of the Engadget blog (http://www.engadget.com).

It is released under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
License (LGPL).  You should have received a copy of the LGPL along
with this program; it's in a file called COPYING.  If not, write to
the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330,
Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA, or see
<http://www.fsf.org/licenses/lgpl.txt>.

Where the LGPL refers to "source code", I take that to refer to the
file called Engadget.sfd, which is a file for editing with
pfaedit (see <http://pfaedit.sourceforge.net>), an outline font editor
program.  Pfaedit is not LGPLed, but its license does seem to count as
free software (it's BSD-style, without the advertising clause).  Thus,
according to the LGPL, if you distribute this font, you must make
Engadget.sfd available to the recipient(s) under the terms
the LGPL specifies for source availability.

At the time of this writing, Engadget.sfd is available on my
Website at <http://www.thibault.org/fonts/engadget/>.
