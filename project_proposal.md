# Access Code 2.2 Final Project Proposal

**Project Name: Shoutout**  
**Team Name: Team Shoutout**  
**Team Members: Jason Wang, Mesfin Mekonnen, Diana Elezaj,Varindra Hart**  

## The Problem 

Our project aims to build an application that will allow its' users to create, edit, compile and send videos.

Existing products in this sphere fall short on the last feature above, namely 'sending'. The apps we have researched so far only perform one or two of the features we plan to implement. 

 In surveying the App store, we could not find an application that currently implements all the features above. However, popular resources in the realm of video editing and merging include:

* [Video Meger] (https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/video-merger-free-combine/id880953154?mt=8) -  Easily merge videos on your device.  (free, iPhone and iPad).
* [Glide] (https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/glide-live-video-messenger/id588199307?mt=8) - Glide is the live video messaging app for people who want more personality and expression when communicating with those who know them best.
 
* [Tribute] (https://www.tribute.co/) - A “Tribute” is the perfect gift for any important occasion. It is a video montage created by a group ("The Tribe”) that comes together to share their appreciation, admiration and encouragement for a person they all care for.

Shoutout is a social collaboration platform, as such we envision our primary users to be kids as young as teenagers and adults as old as grandparents (realizing that we'll need a UI/UX that can appeal to this full age range). Our app aims to have a simplistic design, one that doesn't bombard the user with features or ads, but displays only the crutial elements they need to create videos, merge videos, send videos or invite friends.

## The Solution 

This project will focus on allowing the user to create a shoutout - a video compilation designed to be collaborative and sharable. 

The two categories this project aims to expand on are:

####Video Compilation
* editing, reordering, and compiling of multiple video tracks

####Social Incorporation
* allows the creator to receive and compile video feed from friends who were invited to collaborate. 

The app should be fun and easy to use, with a clear user flow and intuitive design. 


###Bonus Features

* Advanced sharing features allowing the user to share via twitter, FB, Instagram..
* Video filters and interactive tool/screen additions
* The use of an interconnected website will allow the app to more accessible to non-iOS users and iOS carriers interested in the app
* Addition of branch.io for deep link attributes (makes for better on boarding)

| Week 2 |Nov 9-15| Research II: Submit revised proposal (11/10). Begin experimenting with hardware and writing code to interface Android with hardware. Research programming environments for children. |
| Week 3 | Nov 16-22| Development I: Build Android-Hardware interface. Experiment with programming environment. Prototype graphical language. Experiment with robot design.|
| Week 4 | Nov 23-29| Development III: Enrich UI/UX. Build robot assembly walkthrough activity. Finalize app. |
| Week 5 | Nov 30-Dec 6| Testing I: Write tests and debug. Polish features for the second release. Implement bonuses. |
| Week 6 | Dec 8, 5pm | Final Demo Day at Google |

#### Team Member Responsibilities

**Mesfin:**

UI/UX - Wireframes of screens, storyboards of new user experience, sitemap to show activities that users have access to from each activity, maintaining consistent design feel through the app, working with programming language to decide how the interface is setup.

**Varindra:**

Creating a programming language to control the robot's movements - creating Scratch-like programming language that is an engaging but easy to understand, drag-and-drop interface on Android. Ensuring language is inline with robot's capabilities.

**Jason:**

Communication between Android and Arduino/robot - communication between Arduino and Android device through serial port, ensuring our programming language commands are properly transferred between hardware, possibly use a translator.

**Diana:**

Manages the team to ensure work is on track with timeline, rotates between jobs to help where needed, design of robot, will help with the communication between Arduino and Android, will help with programming language, parts are already ordered and should be here between Monday and Tuesday ([project hardware inventory](https://github.com/jaellysbales/access-robot/blob/master/hardware-list.md)).
